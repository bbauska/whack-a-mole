# whack-a-mole
Whack a mole game.

Approach:
Start by creating the HTML structure for your Whack-A-Mole game. Use semantic tags like <header>, <main>, and include elements for game information (score, timer) and the game container with mole holes.
Style your game using CSS to create an appealing layout and you have to use this mole image.
Use JavaScript to add interactivity to your Whack-A-Mole game.
Select DOM elements and initialize game variables.
Implement core functions for mole appearance (comeout) and handling clicks (handleMoleClick).
Create functions to start the game, initiating intervals, and updating UI elements. Implement the end game function, clearing intervals, and resetting the game state.
Add event listeners to buttons, ensuring proper states (disabled/enabled).
